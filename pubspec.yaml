# The following section is specific to Flutter.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: DroidSans
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/DroidSans.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/DroidSans-Bold.ttf
           style: italic
     - family: Ubuntu
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Ubuntu-Title.ttf
           weight: 800
     - family: UbuntuMono
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/UbuntuMono-RI.ttf
           weight: 500
     - family: Exo
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Exo-Light.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Exo-Thin.ttf
